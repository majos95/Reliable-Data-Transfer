# Reliable-Data-Transfer
In this project you will learn the basics of reliable data transfer using a simplified automatic repeat request (ARQ) approach. Towards this end we will be developing a simple file transfer system built on unreliable UDP messages. This system will include a client (acting as the file sender) that reads a file and sends it over to a remote server (the file receiver) that stores a new copy of it.
